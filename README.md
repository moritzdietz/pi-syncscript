![BitTorrent Sync loves Raspberry Pi](http://d3f61ff4egbtyy.cloudfront.net/monthly_2016_01/bts_loves_pi_forum.png.b4ba9fc38c01ea35e4b79a3ee7879ed5.png) 
Raspberry Pi + Sync Script
=======

This is a script to manage your [BitTorrent Sync](https://www.getsync.com/) installation on your [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

Full disclosure: This script won't work reliably for you anymore since I have moved on from this method. I would advise you to use the public repository to install and manage Sync. It is kept here if anybody wants to poke around in it and see if anything is useful for her or him in another project.
Click [here](./old_readme.md) to get to the original readme of this project.

Thank you.
